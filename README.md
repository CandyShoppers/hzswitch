# Hzswitch
A Rhythmbox-Plugin which allows to change music from 440Hz to 432Hz on the fly.
It works best with classical music but can be used for any kind of music.

# Install
1)Click on the green button "Clone or download"


2)Click on "Download Zip"


3)Extract the directory "hzswitch-master" from the zip file


4)Simply copy the entire directory to the Rhythmbox plugins directory.

For a local user on a UNIX-like system, this is ~/.local/share/rhythmbox/plugins

The full path would looks something like:
/home/username/.local/share/rhythmbox/plugins/

If there is no plugins directory you have to create it


6)Start Rhythmbox


7)In Rhythmbox click on "Tools"->"Plugins"


8)Activate Hz Switch by checking the box next to it.
Next to the "random symbol" a new button will appear "440Hz to 432Hz"


9)HAVE FUN!
